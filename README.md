#  Retail Sales Data Analytics  

##  Overview  
Welcome to my **end-to-end data analytics project!**  
This repository showcases a **complete data analysis workflow** using **Python and SQL**, focused on retail order data.  

It demonstrates my ability to:  
- Handle **real-world datasets** (from Kaggle API).  
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** using Python.  
- Load data into a **SQL Server database**.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with SQL queries.  
- Deliver **actionable insights** for business decisions.

##  Project Workflow  

###  1. Data Extraction  
- Leveraged **Kaggle API** to download datasets programmatically.  

###  2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python + Pandas)  
- Handled missing values  
- Normalized and formatted columns  
- Removed duplicates  
- Prepared the dataset for SQL analysis  

###  3. Database Integration (SQL Server)  
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into **SQL Server**  
- Built SQL queries to aggregate, filter, and explore sales data  

###  4. Data Analysis (SQL)  
- Aggregated revenue trends  
- Identified top-selling products  
- Segmented customers based on purchase frequency & value  
- Analyzed seasonal sales and peak periods
